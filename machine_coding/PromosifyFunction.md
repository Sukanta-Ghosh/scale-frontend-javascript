Hereâ€™s a detailed solution approach for the promisify function:

1. **Understanding the Inputs:** The promisify function takes a single argument, fn, which is the function to be promisified.

2. **Returning a Function:** The promisify function itself returns a new function. This returned function will be the promisified version of the original function fn.

3. **Using Rest Parameters:** The returned function uses the rest parameter syntax (...args) to accept any number of arguments. This is because the original function fn might have multiple arguments that need to be passed when invoking it.

4. **Creating a Promise:** Inside the returned function, a new promise is created using the Promise constructor. The promise takes a resolver function as an argument.

5. **Defining the Resolver Function:** The resolver function is defined with a resolve parameter. This resolve parameter is used to resolve the promise with a value when the asynchronous operation is completed.

6. **Creating a Callback Function:** Inside the resolver function, a callback function cb is defined. This callback function will be passed as the last argument to the original function fn.

7. **Resolving the Promise:** When the callback function cb is called, it receives the result of the asynchronous operation. In this case, the resolve function is invoked with the result as an argument, resolving the promise with that value.

8. **Invoking the Original Function:** After defining the callback function, the original function fn is invoked using the apply method. The apply method is used to set the correct this context for the function and pass the arguments from args array along with the callback function cb as the last argument.

9. **Returning the Promise:** Finally, the promise is returned from the returned function. This allows the caller to chain .then() or .catch() methods to handle the resolved value or any potential errors.

By following this solution approach, the promisify function effectively converts any function with a callback into a promisified version that can be used with promises and take advantage of their benefits, such as better control flow and error handling.
